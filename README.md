# Dota 2 Voice Assistant
Dota 2 Voice Assistant is an overwolf app that reminds players of various tasks and cooldowns. This app uses only data gathered from the dota 2 game state integration given by Overwolf's Dota 2 API and is fully compliant with dota 2 TOS.

## List of Features
 1. Stack Reminder: occurs every x:40 second to give ample time to go to the nearest camp and stack.
 2. Observer Ward in stock: will let player know that an observer ward has become available.
 3. BKB cooldown: will let player know that BKB has come off cooldown.
 4. Rosh respawn:  will let player know when roshan might be alive (Roshan min respawn is 8 mins) and when roshan is definitely alive (Roshan max respawn is 11 mins). Note that this only works when the player took the aegis as data gathered from Dota 2 is only that of the player's.
